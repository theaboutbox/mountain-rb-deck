Mountain.rb Card Scoring Application
====================================

This is a simple Sinatra app that will score your cards for you.

Running
-------

# Clone the Git repository
# bundle install
# ruby app.rb
# Go to http://localhost:4567 in your browser

Tests
-----

Given the mission critical importance of this application we strive for total test coverage. To run the tests:

* rake spec:all
* cucumber

Notes
-----
I did not put a lot of time into handling pluralization or wonky capitalization of things.
Thank you, Marty, and all of the wonderful speakers at the conference.
